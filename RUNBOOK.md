## Meta

| Field | Value |

| Last updated | 2026-05-31 |
| Status | Active |
| Project | invoice-payment-reconciliation-automation |
| Environment | Windows 11, PowerShell, uv, Python 3.12+ |

## Prerequisites

- Windows PowerShell.
- `uv` installed and available on `PATH`.
- Python 3.12 or newer available locally, or installable by `uv`.
- No secrets, service accounts, paid API keys, or external services are
  required for the local demo.

Install `uv` from the
[official uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
if it is not already available.

## Setup

After cloning the repository, open PowerShell in the repository root, the
directory that contains `pyproject.toml`, and sync the locked development
environment:

```powershell
uv sync --locked --dev
```

## Quality Gate

Run the default validation commands:

```powershell
uv sync --locked --dev
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run reconcile --help
uv run reconcile report --help
```

## GitHub Actions CI

The minimal CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pull requests and
pushes. It installs `uv`, syncs from `uv.lock`, and runs the same core quality
gate plus CSV and XLSX demo smoke commands.

CI writes demo outputs only inside the runner under `reports/ci-csv` and
`reports/ci-xlsx`. It does not upload artifacts, deploy, or use secrets.

## Portfolio Demo Workflow

Use this workflow when reviewing the public portfolio repository:

1. Run the quality gate.
2. Generate the CSV demo reports under `reports\demo-csv`.
3. Generate the XLSX-input demo reports under `reports\demo-xlsx`.
4. Confirm both output directories contain the same four report files.
5. Compare the generated reports with `docs/demo-output/mixed-demo/` when a
   quick expected-output reference is needed.

## Demo Commands

Run the CSV-input portfolio demo:

```powershell
uv run reconcile report --invoices sample-data/mixed-demo/invoices.csv --payments sample-data/mixed-demo/payments.csv --out-dir reports\demo-csv
```

Run the XLSX-input portfolio demo:

```powershell
uv run reconcile report --invoices sample-data/mixed-demo/invoices.xlsx --payments sample-data/mixed-demo/payments.xlsx --out-dir reports\demo-xlsx
```

Each command prints a `Report files written:` message and writes exactly four
files in the selected output directory:

- `reconciliation-report.md`
- `reconciliation-summary.csv`
- `reconciliation-details.csv`
- `reconciliation-workbook.xlsx`

Verify the output file list:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Name -LiteralPath reports\demo-csv
Get-ChildItem -Name -LiteralPath reports\demo-xlsx
```

Inspect the Markdown report:

```powershell
Get-Content -Raw -LiteralPath reports\demo-csv\reconciliation-report.md
```

Confirm CSV-input and XLSX-input report content equivalence:

```powershell
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -LiteralPath reports\demo-csv\reconciliation-report.md, reports\demo-xlsx\reconciliation-report.md
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -LiteralPath reports\demo-csv\reconciliation-summary.csv, reports\demo-xlsx\reconciliation-summary.csv
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -LiteralPath reports\demo-csv\reconciliation-details.csv, reports\demo-xlsx\reconciliation-details.csv
```

The matching hashes should be identical for each corresponding Markdown/CSV
file because the mixed CSV and XLSX sample inputs describe the same synthetic
scenario. Inspect workbook sheet names and key values through Excel-compatible
tools or the automated tests rather than comparing XLSX binary hashes.

## Cleanup

Remove local generated demo outputs when you want to rerun the walkthrough from
clean output directories:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -LiteralPath reports\demo-csv, reports\demo-xlsx
```

This removes ignored local demo artifacts only. Keep `reports\.gitkeep` in
place.

## Current CLI Behavior

The `reconcile` command supports help, version output, and a local report
workflow. The report command loads invoice and payment CSV or XLSX files, runs
deterministic exact-reference matching, and writes local Markdown, CSV, and XLSX
workbook reports. This runbook does not cover deployment, hosted services,
databases, or production data handling because those are outside the current
portfolio scope.

```powershell
uv run reconcile --version
uv run reconcile report --invoices sample-data/valid-invoices.csv --payments sample-data/valid-payments.csv --out-dir reports\clean
```

The Markdown report includes:

- Reconciliation totals.
- Status summary counts.
- Matched records.
- Invoices missing payments.
- Payments missing invoices.
- Amount variances with underpaid/overpaid notes.
- Currency conflicts.
- Duplicate references needing review.

The summary CSV contains one row per status. The details CSV contains sorted
detail rows with stable status values, readable status labels, source row
numbers, and exception review notes. The workbook contains separate `Summary`,
`Matched`, `Exceptions`, `Invoice Exceptions`, `Payment Exceptions`, and
`Details` sheets.

## Example Output Snapshot

The repository includes a small generated example under
`docs/demo-output/mixed-demo/`. It was generated from the mixed CSV sample data
and contains Markdown, CSV, and XLSX workbook report examples:

- `docs/demo-output/mixed-demo/reconciliation-report.md`
- `docs/demo-output/mixed-demo/reconciliation-summary.csv`
- `docs/demo-output/mixed-demo/reconciliation-details.csv`
- `docs/demo-output/mixed-demo/reconciliation-workbook.xlsx`

Use this snapshot for quick reviewer inspection. Use the `reports/` directory
for local generated output during demos.

## Sample Data

Synthetic CSV and XLSX files live in `sample-data/`:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath sample-data
```

The clean `valid-*` files produce only matched records. The files under
`sample-data/mixed-demo/` produce the main portfolio scenario with matched
records, unmatched records, amount variance, currency conflict, and
duplicate-reference exceptions. The mixed CSV and XLSX inputs are intentionally
equivalent.

## Data Handling

- Use `sample-data/` for synthetic demo inputs only.
- Use `reports/` for generated local outputs.
- Generated report files under `reports/` are ignored by Git.
- Only intentional synthetic examples belong under `docs/demo-output/`.
- Real client data, production exports, secrets, credentials, and private
  information must not be stored in this repository.

## Manual Commit Policy

Keep Git changes manual for this portfolio project. Do not stage, unstage,
commit, push, reset, or rewrite Git history through automation. After manual
review, the repository owner may run Git commands to stage, commit, and push.

Before committing manually, review:

```powershell
git status --short
git diff -- .
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `uv` is not recognized | uv is not installed or not on PATH | Install uv and reopen PowerShell |
| `reconcile` is not found | Environment is not synced | Run `uv sync --locked --dev` from the repository root |
| `reconcile report` returns import errors | Input rows are invalid | Use the synthetic samples or fix the demo input |
| Ruff format check fails | A Python file needs formatting | Run `uv run ruff format .`, then rerun gates |
| Tests fail | Behavior or environment issue | Stop, inspect the failure, and record the unresolved risk in validation notes |
