## Product Brief

Build a local Python CLI tool that imports invoice and payment exports, validates
and normalizes the data, matches payments to invoices, detects exceptions, and
generates review-ready reconciliation reports.

The project is a portfolio/demo project. It must use synthetic data only and must
not require deployment, paid services, runtime external services, databases, or
real client data.

## Phase 1 Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Signal | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1-001 | Define invoice, payment, money amount, and import diagnostic schemas. | Domain models exist under `src/invoice_reconciliation/`. | Implemented |
| P1-002 | Add synthetic invoice and payment CSV files. | Valid and invalid CSV files exist under `sample-data/`. | Implemented |
| P1-003 | Load invoice and payment CSV files without new runtime dependencies. | CSV loaders use Python standard library `csv`. | Implemented |
| P1-004 | Validate required fields, ISO dates, and decimal amounts. | Invalid rows return structured validation errors. | Implemented |
| P1-005 | Normalize whitespace and currency values. | Tests cover trimmed fields and uppercased currency codes. | Implemented |

## Phase 2 Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Signal | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2-001 | Match normalized invoice and payment records by exact reference. | Pure matcher accepts Phase 1 `InvoiceRecord` and `PaymentRecord` values. | Implemented |
| P2-002 | Match only one invoice to one payment when reference, currency, and amount agree. | Successful matches return explicit `matched` status values. | Implemented |
| P2-003 | Classify unmatched invoices and payments. | Result structures include stable `unmatched_invoice` and `unmatched_payment` outputs. | Implemented |
| P2-004 | Classify amount and currency mismatches separately. | Result structures include stable `amount_mismatch` and `currency_mismatch` outputs. | Implemented |
| P2-005 | Classify duplicate invoice or payment references as ambiguous. | Duplicate references return `ambiguous_reference` with a client-readable reason. | Implemented |
| P2-006 | Keep fuzzy matching, reports, XLSX, databases, web APIs, and external services out of scope. | No future-phase behavior is added. | Implemented |

## Phase 3 Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Signal | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P3-001 | Generate a deterministic Markdown reconciliation report from Phase 2 results. | Report includes summary counts, matches, unmatched records, mismatches, and ambiguous references. | Implemented |
| P3-002 | Generate deterministic CSV outputs for spreadsheet review. | Summary and detail CSV files include stable columns, client-readable status labels, and all Phase 2 status categories. | Implemented |
| P3-003 | Add a simple local CLI report command for CSV inputs. | `reconcile report --invoices ... --payments ... --out-dir ...` writes local report files. | Implemented |
| P3-004 | Preserve deterministic ordering and avoid mutating input records. | Tests cover stable CSV ordering and unchanged input record collections. | Implemented |
| P3-005 | Keep XLSX, Excel workbook output, fuzzy matching, databases, web APIs, and external services out of scope. | No future-phase behavior is added. | Implemented |

|---|---|---|---|
| P4-001 | Add a deterministic mixed CSV demo scenario for portfolio review. | Mixed sample inputs include matched records and each implemented exception category. | Implemented |
| P4-002 | Keep the mixed demo synthetic and local-demo-first. | Sample rows are fake and report output remains local. | Implemented |
| P4-003 | Add smoke coverage for mixed-demo parseability and output containment. | Tests verify mixed sample counts and report files stay inside the requested output directory. | Implemented |

## Phase 5 Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Signal | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P5-001 | Load invoice XLSX files through the same normalization and validation rules as CSV files. | `load_invoice_xlsx` returns validated records and structured diagnostics. | Implemented |
| P5-002 | Load payment XLSX files through the same normalization and validation rules as CSV files. | `load_payment_xlsx` returns validated records and structured diagnostics. | Implemented |
| P5-003 | Preserve existing CSV input behavior and report outputs. | Existing CSV tests and CSV CLI smoke commands continue to pass. | Implemented |
| P5-004 | Add mixed synthetic XLSX sample files equivalent to the deterministic mixed CSV demo. | Mixed CSV and XLSX sample inputs produce equivalent status counts. | Implemented |
| P5-005 | Keep fuzzy matching, databases, web APIs, and external services out of scope. | CLI stays deterministic and local-demo-first. | Implemented |

## Phase 6 Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Signal | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P6-001 | Improve Markdown report clarity for portfolio/client demos without changing matching semantics. | Markdown includes concise totals, clearer status summary labels, sorted detail sections, and no empty placeholder sections. | Implemented |
| P6-002 | Improve exception detail readability for unmatched, underpaid/overpaid, currency conflict, and duplicate-reference cases. | Markdown and details CSV include client-readable review notes while preserving stable status values. | Implemented |
| P6-003 | Preserve deterministic Markdown, summary CSV, and details CSV report outputs. | CLI writes `reconciliation-report.md`, `reconciliation-summary.csv`, and `reconciliation-details.csv`. | Implemented |
| P6-004 | Keep CSV and XLSX input behavior unchanged. | Existing CSV/XLSX ingestion and equivalence tests continue to pass. | Implemented |
| P6-005 | Keep web apps, databases, deployment, runtime external services, and matching changes out of scope. | No future-phase components or dependencies are added. | Implemented |

## Phase 7 Requirements

| P7-002 | Document exact local demo commands and expected output files. | Docs show CSV and XLSX-input commands and list generated report files. | Implemented |
| P7-003 | Include a small generated demo-output snapshot only if it helps reviewer clarity. | `docs/demo-output/mixed-demo/` contains report examples generated from existing sample data. | Implemented |
| P7-004 | Preserve current reconciliation, ingestion, and report-generation behavior. | No core logic changes, new dependencies, web app, database, deployment, runtime external service, or XLSX report output are added. | Implemented |

## Phase 8 Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Signal | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P8-001 | Complete a final local release-readiness review for the portfolio version. | Source-of-truth docs, setup steps, demo commands, generated outputs, limitations, sample-data notes, and quality-gate instructions are reviewed against current behavior. | Implemented |
| P8-002 | Verify documented CSV and XLSX demo commands from clean local output directories. | `reports\demo-csv` and `reports\demo-xlsx` are regenerated with expected local outputs. | Implemented |
| P8-003 | Verify repository hygiene for a public portfolio demo. | Ignored report artifacts remain ignored, `docs/demo-output/` contains only intentional synthetic examples, and no accidental secrets, paid API assumptions, large binaries, generated cache files, or unrelated tracked artifacts are found. | Implemented |
| P8-004 | Preserve current runtime behavior. | No reconciliation, ingestion, report-generation, dependency, deployment, web, database, runtime external service, paid API, secret, commit, push, staging, or history changes are made. | Implemented |
